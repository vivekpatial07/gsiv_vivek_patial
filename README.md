The Remix dev server starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes. To start the Remix dev server:

Open up [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), and you should be ready to go!

## Deployment
This app is using fly deployment. To deploy this app create an account on fly and login to fly using your terminal. Then it's just flyctl launch -> fly deploy.

It'll build the image and deploy the app to fly servers and provide you with the url.
